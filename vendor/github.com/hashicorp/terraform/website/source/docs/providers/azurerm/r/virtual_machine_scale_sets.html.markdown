* `admin_password` - (Required) Specifies the administrator password to use for all the instances of virtual machines in a scale set..
* `custom_data` - (Optional) Specifies a base-64 encoded string of custom data. The base-64 encoded string is decoded to a binary array that is saved as a file on all the Virtual Machines in the scale set. The maximum length of the binary array is 65535 bytes.

`os_profile_secrets` supports the following:

* `source_vault_id` - (Required) Specifies the key vault to use.
* `vault_certificates` - (Required, on windows machines) A collection of Vault Certificates as documented below

* `subnet_id` - (Required) Specifies the identifier of the subnet.
* `load_balancer_backend_address_pool_ids` - (Optional) Specifies an array of references to backend address pools of load balancers. A scale set can reference backend address pools of one public and one internal load balancer. Multiple scale sets cannot use the same load balancer.

`storage_profile_os_disk` supports the following:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the disk name.
* `vhd_containers` - (Required) Specifies the vhd uri.
* `create_option` - (Required) Specifies how the virtual machine should be created. The only possible option is `FromImage`.
* `caching` - (Required) Specifies the caching requirements.
* `image` - (Optional) Specifies the blob uri for user image. A virtual machine scale set creates an os disk in the same container as the user image.
                       Updating the osDisk image causes the existing disk to be deleted and a new one created with the new image. If the VM scale set is in Manual upgrade mode then the virtual machines are not updated until they have manualUpgrade applied to them.
