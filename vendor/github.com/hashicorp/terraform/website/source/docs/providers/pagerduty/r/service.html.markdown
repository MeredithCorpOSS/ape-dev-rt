# pagerduty\_service

A [service](https://v2.developer.pagerduty.com/v2/page/api-reference#!/Services/get_services) represents something you monitor (like a web service, email service, or database service). It is a container for related incidents that associates them with escalation policies.


## Example Usage

```
resource "pagerduty_user" "example" {
    name  = "Earline Greenholt"
    email = "125.greenholt.earline@graham.name"
    teams = ["${pagerduty_team.example.id}"]
}

resource "pagerduty_escalation_policy" "foo" {
  name      = "Engineering Escalation Policy"
  num_loops = 2

  rule {
    escalation_delay_in_minutes = 10

    target {
      type = "user"
      id   = "${pagerduty_user.example.id}"
    }
  }
}

resource "pagerduty_service" "example" {
  name                    = "My Web App"
  auto_resolve_timeout    = 14400
  acknowledgement_timeout = 600
  escalation_policy       = "${pagerduty_escalation_policy.example.id}"
}
```
