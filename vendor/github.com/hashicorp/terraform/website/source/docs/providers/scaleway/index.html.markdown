# Scaleway Provider

The Scaleway provider is used to manage Scaleway resources.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

Here is an example that will setup the following:
+ An ARM Server.
+ An IP Address.
+ A security group.

(create this as sl.tf and run terraform commands from this directory):

```hcl
provider "scaleway" {
  organization = ""
  access_key = ""
  region = "par1"
}

resource "scaleway_ip" "ip" {
  server = "${scaleway_server.test.id}"
}

resource "scaleway_server" "test" {
  name = "test"
  image = "aecaed73-51a5-4439-a127-6d8229847145"
  type = "C2S"
}

resource "scaleway_volume" "test" {
  name = "test"
  size_in_gb = 20
  type = "l_ssd"
}

resource "scaleway_volume_attachment" "test" {
  server = "${scaleway_server.test.id}"
  volume = "${scaleway_volume.test.id}"
}

resource "scaleway_security_group" "http" {
  name = "http"
  description = "allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic"
}

resource "scaleway_security_group_rule" "http_accept" {
  security_group = "${scaleway_security_group.http.id}"

  action = "accept"
  direction = "inbound"
  ip_range = "0.0.0.0/0"
  protocol = "TCP"
  port = 80
}

resource "scaleway_security_group_rule" "https_accept" {
  security_group = "${scaleway_security_group.http.id}"

  action = "accept"
  direction = "inbound"
  ip_range = "0.0.0.0/0"
  protocol = "TCP"
  port = 443
}

```

You'll need to provide your Scaleway organization access key
(available in Scaleway panel in *Credentials > Tokens > access key*)
and token (you can generate it in the same section), so that Terraform can connect.
If you don't want to put credentials in your configuration file,
you can leave them out:

```
provider "scaleway" {
  organization = ""
  access_key = ""
  region = "par1"
}
```

...and instead set these environment variables:

- **SCALEWAY_ORGANIZATION**: Your Scaleway organization `access key`
- **SCALEWAY_ACCESS_KEY**: Your API access `token`
- **SCALEWAY_REGION**: The Scaleway region
