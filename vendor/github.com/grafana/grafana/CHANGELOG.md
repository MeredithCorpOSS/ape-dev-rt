**Breaking Changes**
- Notice to makers/users of custom data sources, there is a minor breaking change in 2.2 that
require an update to custom data sources for them to work in 2.2. [Read this doc](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/tree/master/docs/sources/datasources/plugin_api.md) for more on the
data source api change.
- Data source api changes, [PLUGIN_CHANGES.md](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/master/public/app/plugins/PLUGIN_CHANGES.md)
- The duplicate query function used in data source editors is changed, and moveMetricQuery function was renamed

**Tech (Note for devs)**
Started using Typescript (transpiled to ES5), uncompiled typescript files and less files are in public folder (in source tree)
This folder is never modified by build steps. Compiled css and javascript files are put in public_gen, all other files
that do not undergo transformation are just copied from public to public_gen, it is public_gen that is used by grafana-server
if it is found.

Grunt & Watch tasks:
- `grunt` : default task, will remove public_gen, copy over all files from public, do less & typescript compilation
- `grunt watch`: will watch for changes to less, and typescript files and compile them to public_gen, and for other files it will just copy them to public_gen

**UI polish / changes**
- [Issue #725](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/725). UI: All modal editors are removed and replaced by an edit pane under menu. The look of editors is also updated and polished. Search dropdown is also shown as pane under menu and has seen some UI polish.

**Filtering/Templating feature overhaul**
- Filtering renamed to Templating, and filter items to variables
- Filter editing has gotten its own edit pane with much improved UI and options
- [Issue #296](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/296). Templating: Can now retrieve variable values from a non-default data source
- [Issue #219](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/219). Templating: Template variable value selection is now a typeahead autocomplete dropdown
- [Issue #760](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/760). Templating: Extend template variable syntax to include $variable syntax replacement
- [Issue #234](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/234). Templating: Interval variable type for time intervals summarize/group by parameter, included "auto" option, and auto step counts option.
- [Issue #262](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/262). Templating: Ability to use template variables for function parameters via custom variable type, can be used as parameter for movingAverage or scaleToSeconds for example
- [Issue #312](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/312). Templating: Can now use template variables in panel titles
- [Issue #613](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/613). Templating: Full support for InfluxDB, filter by part of series names, extract series substrings, nested queries, multipe where clauses!
- Template variables can be initialized from url, with var-my_varname=value, breaking change, before it was just my_varname.
- Templating and url state sync has some issues that are not solved for this release, see [Issue #772](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/772) for more details.

**InfluxDB Breaking changes**
- To better support templating, fill(0) and group by time low limit some changes has been made to the editor and query model schema
- Currently some of these changes are breaking
- If you used custom condition filter you need to open the graph in edit mode, the editor will update the schema, and the queries should work again
- If you used a raw query you need to remove the time filter and replace it with $timeFilter (this is done automatically when you switch from query editor to raw query, but old raw queries needs to updated)
- If you used group by and later removed the group by the graph could break, open in editor and should correct it
- InfluxDB annotation queries that used [[timeFilter]] should be updated to use $timeFilter syntax instead
- Might write an upgrade tool to update dashboards automatically, but right now master (1.8) includes the above breaking changes

**InfluxDB query editor enhancements**
- [Issue #756](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/756). InfluxDB: Add option for fill(0) and fill(null), integrated help in editor for why this option is important when stacking series
- [Issue #743](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/743). InfluxDB: A group by time option for all queries in graph panel that supports a low limit for auto group by time, very important for stacking and fill(0)
- The above to enhancements solves the problems associated with stacked bars and lines when points are missing, these issues are solved:
- [Issue #673](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/673). InfluxDB: stacked bars missing intermediate data points, unless lines also enabled
- [Issue #674](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/674). InfluxDB: stacked chart ignoring series without latest values
- [Issue #534](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/534). InfluxDB: No order in stacked bars mode

### New Features and improvements
- Support for second optional params for functions like aliasByNode ([Issue #167](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/167)). Read the wiki on the [Function Editor](https://github.com/torkelo/grafana/wiki/Graphite-Function-Editor) for more info.

### Fixes
- Float arguments now work for functions like scale ([Issue #223](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/223))
- Fix for graphite function editor, the graph & target was not updated after adding a function and leaving default params as is #191

The zip files now contains a sub folder with project name and version prefix. ([Issue #209](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/209))

# 1.5.1 (2014-03-10)
### Fixes
- maxDataPoints must be an integer #184 (thanks @frejsoya for fixing this)

For people who are find Grafana slow for large time spans or high resolution metrics. This is most likely due to graphite returning a large number of datapoints. The maxDataPoints parameter solves this issue. For maxDataPoints to work you need to run the latest graphite-web (some builds of 0.9.12 does not include this feature).
