# Keyboard Shortcuts

No mouse? No problem. Grafana has extensive keyboard shortcuts to allow you to navigate throughout the interface. This comes in especially handy when dealing with dealing with single-purpose machines powering on-wall displays that may not have a mouse available.

## Dashboard Keyboard Shortcuts

Press `Shift`+`?` to open the keyboard shortcut dialog from anywhere within the dashboard views.
