## 1.0.0 (September 26, 2017)

BUG FIXES:

* d/consul_agent_self: The `enable_ui` config setting was always set to false, regardless of the actual agent configuration ([#16](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-consul/issues/16))

## 0.1.0 (June 20, 2017)

NOTES:

* Same functionality as that of Terraform 0.9.8. Repacked as part of [Provider Splitout](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/upcoming-provider-changes-in-terraform-0-10/)
