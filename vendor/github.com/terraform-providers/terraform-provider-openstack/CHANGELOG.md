## 0.1.0 (Unreleased)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* You can now specify `region` in the provider block. All resources will inherit this region setting, or you can override it in the resource-level `region`. Make sure to do a `plan` before an `apply` to make sure the resource is not destroyed due to incorrectly determining the region! If you see this happening, either explicitly set the `region` in the resource or use `lifecycle.ignore_changes`. 

IMPROVEMENTS:

* Can specify `region` in the provider [GH-25]
