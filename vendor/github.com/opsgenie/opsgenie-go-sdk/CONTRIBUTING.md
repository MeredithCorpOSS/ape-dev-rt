# How to contribute

Your contributions are more than welcomed at OpsGenie! You can contribute to OpsGenie Go SDK by submitting a pull request.

Before pushing your commits, please make sure you followed the steps described below:

1. Run `go fmt` to format your code.
2. Alternatively you can use [goimports](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports), it also formats import lines.
3. [golint](https://github.com/golang/lint) your code to detect style mistakes.
4. [govet](http://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/vet) your code to detect suspicious constructs.
