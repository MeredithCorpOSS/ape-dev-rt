# Installation

We use Homebrew Cask for [distribution](https://github.com/TimeInc/homebrew-cask-tap/blob/master/Casks/ape-dev-rt.rb), see http://brew.sh/ and http://caskroom.io/ for installation instructions of both tools. Do the following when you have both installed:

```
brew tap timeinc/cask-tap git@github.com:timeinc/homebrew-cask-tap.git
brew cask install ape-dev-rt
```
